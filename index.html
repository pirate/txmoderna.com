      <marquee><quot>Hey Moderna ™️: If you choose a domain that's going to be commonly mistyped, you have to make sure you buy the alternate versions so that bad actors can't use them to mislead/phish people.</quot></marquee>

      It seems as if no one learns from the mistakes of <a href="https://docs.monadical.com/s/equifax-security-incident">Equifax Security 2017</a>, contact me <a href="https://twitter.com/theSquashSH">@theSquashSH</a> if you're Moderna ™️ so I can get these domains transferred to you.
      <br/><br/>
      <small>P.S. I have no gripes with Moderna ™️ the company, they're awesome, go get vaccinated ya'll 💉👍.</small>
