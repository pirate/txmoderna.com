It seems as if no one learns from the mistakes of <a href="https://docs.monadical.com/s/equifax-security-incident">Equifax Security 2017</a>.

<quot><b>Hey Moderna: If you're going to choose a domain that's going to be commonly mistyped, at least buy the alternate versions so that hackers can't use it to mislead/phish people.</b></quot>
